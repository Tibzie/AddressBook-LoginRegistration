# Testing 2 main features of AddressBook website


## About

Previously, I had done a test of the registration feature, but I wanted to take it further
by combining the test with another essential feature (login) as well as using other practices.


## What does it do?

* It tests registration and login features in BDD style.
* It ensures elements are loaded promptly before it proceeds to the next steps.
* It takes screenshots of successful login
