#Testing 2 main features of AddressBook website

---

###About

Previously, I've done a test of the registration feature, but I wanted to take it further
by combining the test with another essential feature (login) as well as using other practices.

###What does it do?

* Tests registration and login features in BDD style.
* Ensures elements are loaded promptly before it proceeds to the next steps.
* Takes screenshots of successful login
